# Nextjs-project
# Project Name

## Overview
This project is built using **Next.js 14** with a modular folder structure. The main functionalities include fetching and displaying user and post data through an API. Data is handled on the server side and passed as props to frontend components.

## Folder Structure
```
- /bin                 # (No note module included)
- /blog                # Blog-related components (if applicable)
- /app                 # Next.js main application folder
  - /dashboard         # API calls are handled here and sent as props to frontend
  - /views             # Contains reusable UI components
    - /apps
      - /user         # User-related components
      - /posts        # Post-related components
- /utils               # API utilities and configurations
```

## API Integration
- API configurations are defined in `/utils/api.js`
- API calls are handled in **server-side components** inside `/dashboard`
- Data is fetched and passed via **props** to frontend components

## Project Approach
- **Modular Structure**: Components are structured to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **API Handling**:
  - Fetching is handled in `/dashboard`
  - Passed as props to UI components in `/views/apps/user` and `/views/apps/posts`
- **State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` are used in client components for dynamic updates.
- **Error Handling**: Proper `try-catch` blocks for API requests.
- **Material UI**: Used for styling tables and components.

## Dependencies Used
- `next` (for server-side rendering and routing)
- `react` (for component-based UI development)
- `axios` (for making API requests)
- `@mui/material` (for UI components)
